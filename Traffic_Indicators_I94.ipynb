    "In this project, we will analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway using a [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume) made available by John Hogue. I-94 runs from Billings, Montana, to Port Huron, Michigan through the Great Lakes region in the northern United States. Our data set tracks westbound traffic volume in addition to weather, temperature, date/time, and whether the day was a holiday. The data was acquired from a station located approximately midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul.\n",

    "In looking for indicators of traffic on I-94 westbound we found many useful results. First, there is more high volume traffic during the day than during the night. No surprise there, given that most people live their working lives and run most errands during the day. Second, traffic tends to increase throughout the day, no matter the day, but weekdays--business days--have strong peaks pre-work around 7:00 am and post-work around 4:00 pm. Third, we observed that there is not a large variation in traffic across months of the year, but the average traffic volume tends to be higher during the summer months (with the exception of July) compared to the winter months. This may be due to the fact that winter months entail snow, which people likely want to avoid. Fifth, weekday traffic is heavier than weekend traffic. People like to rest on the weekend--imagine that! Finally, we found that numerical weather indicators did not show a strong relationship to traffic, but some weather descriptions indicate higher or lower traffic trends: proximity rain showers slow traffic dramatically compared to other weather, whereas thunderstorms with heavy rain tend to keep people off of the road. It appears that people believe they can handle rain showers, but when there is thunder they prefer to stay inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if my business were to minimize the traffic faced on I-94, I would have my drivers deliver westbound at night, during the weekends, during the winter, and during heavy thunderstorms and fog. Of course, we might want to factor which of these same traffic indicators may increase risk of car accidents before we make any such decision."
